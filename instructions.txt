Instructions to run the Kinect code that classifies areas of the floor according to drivability

In one terminal, run this:
	roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
(By the way, it's necessary to have the openni package)
This will take the data streams from the Kinect and publish them as ros topics.
To see the ros topics, you can use this command:
	rostopic list

Next, if you want to check what the Kinect is looking at (optional):
(do this in a new terminal)
	rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color
Or, to view the depth map instead of RGB:
	rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image_rect

Next, calibrate the Kinect. Make sure the field of view consists mostly of level floor, and run this:
	rosrun topdown calibrate_bestfit
After it calculates the transform, it will just spin by itself over and over, constantly publishing that same transform.

Now, to get the map that shows what areas are what:
In a new terminal, run this:
	rosrun topdown finalMap
After it's done, it will output a txt file called finalMap.txt. I like to view this in Matlab. It classifies everything as unknown (0), level floor (1), ramps (2), bumps (3), and obstacles (4).
